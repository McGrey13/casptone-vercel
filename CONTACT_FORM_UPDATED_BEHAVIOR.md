   - 📝 Subject field: Empty, editable
   - 📝 Message field: Empty, editable
   - 📘 Blue notice: "You can fill out the form, but you'll need to log in to submit it."

   - Subject: "Question about products"
   - Message: "This is my question with more than ten words typed here"

4. User clicks "Login to Send Message"
   → Redirects to /login
   → Form data is SAVED (won't lose their message!)

5. User logs in
   → Redirects back to /contact
   → Form data is RESTORED with:
     - Name: Now shows logged-in user's name (auto-filled, locked)
     - Email: Now shows logged-in user's email (auto-filled, locked)

When a non-logged-in user fills the form and clicks submit:

1. **Saves to sessionStorage**:
   - Name (temporarily)
   - Email (temporarily)
   - Subject ✅
   - Message ✅

2. **After login**:
   - Name: Replaced with logged-in user's name
   - Email: Replaced with logged-in user's email
   - Subject: RESTORED from saved data ✅
   - Message: RESTORED from saved data ✅

**Result**: User doesn't lose their typed message! 🎉
