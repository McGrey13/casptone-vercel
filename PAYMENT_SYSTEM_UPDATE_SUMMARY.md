        'orderID' => $order->orderID,
        'paymentMethod' => 'cod',
        'paymentStatus' => 'pending',
        'amount' => $totalAmount / 100,
        'currency' => 'PHP',
        'payment_type' => 'cod',
        'orderDate' => now(),
        'reference_number' => 'COD-' . $order->orderID . '-' . time()
    ]);
}
```

### **Payment Model Updates**
