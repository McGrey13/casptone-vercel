  - Comprehensive production environment settings
  - Security, SSL, CORS, and monitoring configurations

- **Security Config**: `backend/config/security.php`
  - Detailed security settings for all aspects
  - Rate limiting, authentication, encryption settings
  - Compliance and monitoring configurations

#### Deployment Tools

4. `backend/public/.htaccess` - HTTPS redirects and security headers

### Frontend Configuration
1. `frontend/src/api.js` - HTTPS API endpoints and credentials

### New Security Files
1. `backend/app/Http/Middleware/SecurityHeaders.php`
2. `backend/app/Http/Middleware/SecureSession.php`
3. `backend/config/production.php`
4. `backend/config/security.php`
5. `backend/app/Console/Commands/SetupHttps.php`

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### For Development (Windows/XAMPP)
1. Update your `.env` file with HTTPS settings:
```env
APP_URL=https://localhost
FORCE_HTTPS=true
SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE=true
SESSION_ENCRYPT=true
```

2. Generate SSL certificates for localhost:
```bash
# Using mkcert (recommended for development)
mkcert -install
mkcert localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1
```

### For Production (Linux)
1. Run the deployment script:
```bash
cd backend
chmod +x deploy-production.sh
./deploy-production.sh
```

2. Or use the Laravel command:
```bash
php artisan https:setup --domain=yourdomain.com
```
