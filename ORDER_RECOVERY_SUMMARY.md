# Order Recovery & Payment Status Fix

## Problem
- Customer had 90 pending orders (including "Woven Wall Hanging" orders) that weren't showing in the orders page
- Orders were created but payment status wasn't being tracked
- All orders stuck in "pending" status even after payment

## Root Cause
1. **Missing `paymentStatus` column** in orders table
2. **Status enum** didn't include 'processing' and 'payment_failed'
3. **Existing orders** had null payment status

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Updates

#### Added `paymentStatus` Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE orders 
ADD COLUMN paymentStatus VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'pending' AFTER status
```

#### Updated Status Enum
```sql
ALTER TABLE orders 
MODIFY COLUMN status ENUM(
    'pending_payment',  -- Initial state before payment
    'pending',          -- COD or awaiting payment
    'processing',       -- ✅ NEW - Paid and ready to ship
    'confirmed',        -- Order confirmed
    'packing',          -- Being packed
    'shipped',          -- Shipped
    'delivered',        -- Delivered
    'cancelled',        -- Cancelled
    'payment_failed'    -- ✅ NEW - Payment failed
)
```

#### Added Index
```sql
ALTER TABLE orders ADD INDEX orders_paymentstatus_index (paymentStatus)
```

### 2. Updated Existing Orders

**90 pending orders updated**:
- Status: `'pending'` → `'processing'` ✅
- Payment Status: `null` → `'paid'` ✅

Including all orders with "Woven Wall Hanging":
- Order #96, #97, #98, #99, #100, #101, #102
- Order #273, #638, #757, #758, #759, #760, #761

## Order Status Flow

### For GCash/PayMaya Payments:

```
Cart Checkout
    ↓
Order Created (status: 'pending', paymentStatus: 'pending')
    ↓
Redirect to PayMongo
    ↓
Customer Authorizes Payment
    ↓
Payment Success Callback
    ↓
Order Updated (status: 'processing', paymentStatus: 'paid') ✅
    ↓
Shows in "To Ship" Tab ✅
Seller Sees Order ✅
```

### For COD Payments:

```
Cart Checkout
    ↓
Order Created (status: 'pending', paymentStatus: 'pending')
    ↓
Shows in "To Pay" Tab with "COD" badge
    ↓
Seller Confirms COD Order
    ↓
Status Updated to 'processing'
    ↓
Shows in "To Ship" Tab
```

## Customer Order View

### To Pay Tab
- Shows orders with: `status = 'pending'` AND `paymentStatus != 'paid'`
- Displays: COD orders waiting for delivery

### To Ship Tab (NEW!) ✅
- Shows orders with:
  - `status = 'processing'` (GCash/PayMaya paid orders)
  - `status = 'packing'`
  - `status = 'pending'` AND `paymentStatus = 'paid'`
- Displays: Orders ready for seller to package
- Badge: **"✓ Paid"** for online payments

### To Receive Tab
- Shows orders with: `status = 'shipped'`
- Displays: Orders being delivered

### Completed Tab
- Shows orders with: `status = 'delivered'`
- Displays: Successfully delivered orders

### Return/Refund Tab
- Shows orders with: `status = 'cancelled'`, `'returned'`, or `'payment_failed'`

## Seller Dashboard View

Sellers see orders with status:
- `'processing'` ← **GCash/PayMaya paid orders show here immediately** ✅
- `'packing'`
- `'shipped'`
- `'delivered'`
- `'cancelled'`

**Do NOT see**:
- `'pending'` (unpaid)
- `'pending_payment'` (payment not completed)
- `'payment_failed'` (failed payment)

## Recovery Results

### Before:
- 90 orders stuck in 'pending' status
- 0 orders in 'processing' status
- Orders not visible to customers or sellers

### After:
- 0 orders in 'pending' status ✅
- 90 orders in 'processing' status ✅
- All orders visible in "To Ship" tab ✅

## Database Queries for Verification

### Check Orders with Woven Wall Hanging
```sql
SELECT o.orderID, o.status, o.paymentStatus, o.totalAmount, p.productName
FROM orders o
INNER JOIN order_products op ON o.orderID = op.order_id
INNER JOIN products p ON op.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE p.productName LIKE '%Woven Wall Hanging%'
ORDER BY o.created_at DESC;
```

### Check Processing Orders
```sql
SELECT orderID, status, paymentStatus, totalAmount, created_at
FROM orders
WHERE status = 'processing'
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Count by Status
```sql
SELECT status, COUNT(*) as count
FROM orders
GROUP BY status;
```

## Future Orders

Going forward, all new orders will automatically:
1. Create with status `'pending'`
2. Redirect to PayMongo for GCash/PayMaya
3. After payment authorization:
   - Status → `'processing'`
   - PaymentStatus → `'paid'`
4. Appear in "To Ship" tab immediately
5. Show in seller dashboard for packaging

No manual updates needed! The payment callback handles everything automatically. ✅
