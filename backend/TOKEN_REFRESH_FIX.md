# Token Refresh Loop Fix 🔧

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**

The token refresh was stuck in an infinite loop because:

1. **Missing Refresh Token Cookie**: The backend was creating a new refresh token but NOT setting it as a cookie
2. **Invalid Cookie Settings**: Cookies were set with `secure: true` in development (HTTP environment)
3. **Token Rotation**: Each refresh deleted the old refresh token and created a new one

## 🔄 **The Loop Process**

1. Frontend calls `/api/auth/refresh-token`
2. Backend deletes old refresh token and creates new one
3. Backend only sets new `access_token` cookie (❌ missing `refresh_token` cookie)
4. Frontend still has old (now invalid) refresh token cookie
5. Next API call fails with 401 (access token expired)
6. Frontend tries to refresh again with old refresh token
7. Backend rejects it because it was already deleted
8. **INFINITE LOOP** 🔄

## ✅ **Fixes Applied**

### 1. **Added Missing Refresh Token Cookie**
```php
// Set new refresh token cookie
$response->cookie(
    'refresh_token',
    $result['refresh_token'],
    config('sanctum.refresh_expiration', 1440),
    '/',
    null,
    env('APP_ENV') === 'production', // secure only in production
    true,
    false,
    'strict'
);
```

### 2. **Environment-Aware Cookie Security**
```php
// OLD: Always secure (causes issues in HTTP development)
true, // secure

// NEW: Only secure in production
env('APP_ENV') === 'production', // secure only in production
```

### 3. **Updated All Cookie Settings**
- ✅ `login()` method
- ✅ `refreshToken()` method  
- ✅ `verifyOtp()` method
- ✅ `logout()` method

## 🧪 **Testing**

1. **Clear browser cookies**: `document.cookie.split(";").forEach(function(c) { document.cookie = c.replace(/^ +/, "").replace(/=.*/, "=;expires=" + new Date().toUTCString() + ";path=/"); });`
2. **Login again**: Should work without refresh loop
3. **Wait for token expiration**: Should refresh automatically once
4. **Check browser dev tools**: Should see both `access_token` and `refresh_token` cookies

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

- ✅ **Single refresh**: Token refreshes only when needed (every ~60 minutes)
- ✅ **Automatic retry**: Failed requests retry once after refresh
- ✅ **Proper logout**: All cookies cleared on logout
- ✅ **Development friendly**: Works on HTTP in development

## 🔍 **Monitoring**

Watch the terminal for:
- ✅ **Normal pattern**: `/api/auth/refresh-token` called occasionally
- ❌ **Loop pattern**: `/api/auth/refresh-token` called continuously every ~500ms

## 📝 **Files Modified**

- `backend/app/Http/Controllers/Auth/SecureAuthController.php`
  - Added missing refresh token cookie in `refreshToken()`
  - Made all cookie settings environment-aware
  - Fixed secure flag for development

The token refresh loop should now be resolved! 🎉
