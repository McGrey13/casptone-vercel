# Payment Tracking & Gateway Simulation - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a complete payment tracking system for sellers with simulated GCash and PayMaya gateway integration. This allows sellers to view all e-wallet payments from customers and simulate the process of connecting their store to payment gateways without requiring actual KYC verification.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Payment Tracking Dashboard (`PaymentTracking.jsx`)
A comprehensive dashboard for sellers to monitor all e-wallet payments from their customers.

#### Key Features:
- **Real-time Payment Monitoring**
  - View all GCash and PayMaya payments
  - Filter by payment method (GCash/PayMaya)
  - Filter by payment status (Paid, Processing, Pending)
  - Search by payment ID, order ID, or customer name

- **Statistics Cards**
  - Total Earnings (all paid payments)
  - Pending Payouts (processing payments)
  - GCash Payments (total from GCash)
  - PayMaya Payments (total from PayMaya)

- **Payment Details View**
  - Detailed modal showing payment information
  - Customer details
  - Reference numbers
  - Payment timestamps
  - Amount details

- **Export Functionality**
  - Export filtered payments to CSV
  - Includes all relevant payment data

#### File Location:
```
frontend/src/Components/Seller/PaymentTracking.jsx
```

### 2. Payment Gateway Setup Simulation (`PaymentGatewaySetup.jsx`)
A realistic simulation of connecting GCash or PayMaya to a seller's store, mimicking the actual child store setup process without requiring real KYC documents.

#### Simulation Steps:

**Step 1: Login**
- Email and password input
- Mobile number (optional)
- Simulated authentication
- Works with any credentials for testing

**Step 2: OTP Verification**
- 6-digit OTP input
- Simulated SMS verification
- Test OTP: `123456`

**Step 3: Success Confirmation**
- Connection success animation
- Account summary display
- Connection status stored in localStorage

#### Key Features:
- Professional UI matching GCash/PayMaya branding
- Gradient colors specific to each gateway
  - GCash: Blue gradient
  - PayMaya: Green gradient
- Smooth transitions between steps
- Form validation
- Success/error handling
- Persistent connection status

#### File Location:
```
frontend/src/Components/Seller/PaymentGatewaySetup.jsx
```

### 3. Updated Payment Settings (`PaymentSettings.jsx`)
Enhanced the existing payment settings page to integrate the gateway simulation.

#### New Features:
- **GCash Connection Card**
  - Connect/Disconnect functionality
  - Connection status indicator
  - Opens simulation modal

- **PayMaya Connection Card**
  - Connect/Disconnect functionality
  - Connection status indicator
  - Opens simulation modal

- **Persistent State**
  - Connection status saved in localStorage
  - Survives page reloads
  - Gateway-specific storage keys

#### File Location:
```
frontend/src/Components/Seller/PaymentSettings.jsx
```

### 4. Seller Navigation Integration (`SellerLayout.jsx`)
Added Payment Tracking to the seller dashboard navigation.

#### Changes:
- New menu item: "Payment Tracking"
- Wallet icon for easy identification
- Positioned between "Payment Settings" and "Orders & Inventory"
- Renders PaymentTracking component when selected

#### File Location:
```
frontend/src/Components/Seller/SellerLayout.jsx
```

### 5. Backend API Implementation (`SellerController.php`)
Created a new endpoint to fetch payment data for authenticated sellers.

#### Endpoint Details:
- **Route**: `GET /api/seller/payments`
- **Middleware**: `auth:sanctum`, `role:seller`, `verified.store`
- **Authentication**: Required (seller only)

#### Functionality:
- Fetches seller's products
- Retrieves all orders containing seller's products
- Joins with payments table
- Filters for GCash and PayMaya only
- Includes customer information
- Calculates statistics:
  - Total earnings
  - Pending payouts
  - GCash-specific totals
  - PayMaya-specific totals

#### Response Format:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "payments": [
    {
      "payment_id": "PAY-001",
      "order_id": "ORD-2025-001",
      "customer_name": "Maria Santos",
      "amount": 1250.00,
      "payment_method": "gcash",
      "payment_status": "paid",
      "created_at": "2025-10-09 10:30:00",
      "reference_number": "GC-20251009-001"
    }
  ],
  "stats": {
    "totalEarnings": 4200.50,
    "pendingPayouts": 850.00,
    "gcashPayments": 3350.00,
    "paymayaPayments": 850.50
  }
}
```

#### File Location:
```
backend/app/Http/Controllers/sellerController.php
```

### 6. API Route Configuration (`api.php`)
Added the new seller payments endpoint to the API routes.

#### Route Definition:
```php
Route::middleware(['role:seller', 'verified.store'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/seller/payments', [SellerController::class, 'getPayments']);
});
```

#### File Location:
```
backend/routes/api.php
```

## How It Works

### Seller Payment Tracking Flow:
1. Seller navigates to "Payment Tracking" in sidebar
2. Frontend calls `/api/seller/payments`
3. Backend fetches seller's products and associated payments
4. Returns GCash/PayMaya payments with customer details
5. Frontend displays payments in a filterable table
6. Seller can view details, filter, search, and export

### Gateway Connection Simulation Flow:
1. Seller goes to "Payment Settings"
2. Clicks "Connect" on GCash or PayMaya card
3. Simulation modal opens with gateway branding
4. Seller enters email, password (any values work)
5. System simulates authentication delay
6. OTP verification step (use `123456`)
7. Success screen shows connection details
8. Connection status saved to localStorage
9. Card updates to show "Connected" status
10. Seller can now "Disconnect" to reset

### Mock Data Fallback:
If backend is unavailable or returns an error, the PaymentTracking component uses mock data to demonstrate functionality:
- Sample payments with realistic Philippine names
- Mixed GCash and PayMaya transactions
- Various payment statuses
- Calculated statistics

## User Interface Features

### Design Elements:
- **Craft-themed color scheme**
  - Primary: `#a4785a` (brown)
  - Secondary: `#7b5a3b` (darker brown)
  - Accents: `#d5bfae`, `#f8f1ec`

- **Professional styling**
  - Gradient headers
  - Shadow effects
  - Smooth transitions
  - Hover states
  - Loading indicators

- **Responsive layout**
  - Mobile-friendly grid
  - Flexible filters
  - Scrollable modals
  - Adaptive tables

### Interactive Elements:
- Filter dropdowns with badges
- Search with live filtering
- Export to CSV button
- Refresh data button
- View payment details modal
- Gateway setup wizard

## Testing Instructions

### Test Payment Tracking:
1. Log in as a seller with a verified store
2. Click "Payment Tracking" in sidebar
3. View mock payment data or real data if available
4. Test filters (All/GCash/PayMaya, status filters)
5. Search for specific payments
6. Click "View" on any payment
7. Try exporting to CSV

### Test Gateway Simulation:
1. Go to "Payment Settings"
2. Click "Connect" on GCash card
3. Enter any email and password
4. Click "Continue"
5. Enter OTP: `123456`
6. Click "Verify"
7. See success screen
8. Click "Finish Setup"
9. Verify GCash card shows "Connected"
10. Repeat for PayMaya
11. Test "Manage" button to disconnect

## Technical Notes

### LocalStorage Keys:
- `gcash_connected`: "true" when GCash is connected
- `paymaya_connected`: "true" when PayMaya is connected

### Database Tables Used:
- `payments`: Payment records
- `orders`: Order information
- `order_items`: Product-order relationships
- `products`: Seller's products
- `sellers`: Seller information
- `users`: Customer names

### Security Considerations:
- Requires seller authentication
- Middleware ensures only sellers can access
- Verified store check
- User-specific data filtering
- No sensitive payment credentials stored

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Real PayMongo Integration**
   - Actual child store creation
   - Real KYC document upload
   - Live transaction processing

2. **Payout Management**
   - Request payout feature
   - Payout history
   - Bank account linking

3. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Payment trends graph
   - Customer demographics
   - Revenue forecasting

4. **Automated Reconciliation**
   - Match payments with bank deposits
   - Discrepancy alerts
   - Financial reports

5. **Multi-currency Support**
   - USD, EUR support
   - Exchange rate handling
   - Currency conversion

## Conclusion

This implementation provides sellers with:
- Complete visibility into e-wallet payments
- Professional payment tracking interface
- Realistic gateway setup experience
- No KYC barriers for testing
- Production-ready code structure
- Extensible architecture for real integration

The simulation approach allows development and testing without actual payment gateway accounts while maintaining the exact user flow that would exist in production.
