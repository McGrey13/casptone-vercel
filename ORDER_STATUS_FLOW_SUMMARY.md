# Order Status Flow - Complete Guide

## Updated Order Status Flow

### ðŸŽ¯ Goal
When customers pay via GCash/PayMaya, orders should immediately show in the "To Ship" section (ready for seller to package), not in "To Pay" since payment is already completed.

## Order Status Lifecycle

### For GCash/PayMaya Payments:

```
1. Checkout Created
   â†“
   Status: 'pending'
   Payment: 'pending'
   Display: "To Pay" (temporary)
   
2. Redirected to PayMongo
   â†“
   User authorizes payment in GCash/PayMaya
   
3. Payment Successful
   â†“
   Status: 'processing' âœ…
   Payment: 'paid' âœ…
   Display: "To Ship" âœ…
   Seller: Can see order and start packaging âœ…
   
4. Seller Packages
   â†“
   Status: 'packing'
   Display: "To Ship"
   
5. Order Shipped
   â†“
   Status: 'shipped'
   Display: "To Receive"
   
6. Order Delivered
   â†“
   Status: 'delivered'
   Display: "Completed"
```

### For COD (Cash on Delivery) Payments:

```
1. Checkout Created
   â†“
   Status: 'pending'
   Payment: 'pending'
   Display: "To Pay" (will pay on delivery)
   
2. Seller Confirms COD
   â†“
   Status: 'processing'
   Payment: 'pending'
   Display: "To Ship"
   
3. Order Shipped
   â†“
   Status: 'shipped'
   Payment: 'pending'
   Display: "To Receive"
   
4. Order Delivered & Payment Collected
   â†“
   Status: 'delivered'
   Payment: 'paid' (collected)
   Display: "Completed"
```

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. `PaymentController.php` - Success Callback
**File**: `backend/app/Http/Controllers/PaymentController.php`

**Changes**:
- When payment is successful, set order status to `'processing'` (not 'pending')
- This immediately makes the order ready for seller to package
- Added payment status to `'paid'`

```php
$order->update([
    'status' => 'processing', // Ready to package/ship
    'paymentStatus' => 'paid'
]);
```

#### 2. `OrderController.php` - Customer Orders
**File**: `backend/app/Http/Controllers/OrderController.php`

**Changes**:
- Added `'packing'` to allowed statuses
- Added `'payment_failed'` to show failed payments
- Returns `paymentStatus` in response
- Updated to show all relevant order statuses

```php
->whereIn('status', ['pending', 'processing', 'packing', 'shipped', 'delivered', 'cancelled', 'payment_failed'])
```

#### 3. `OrderController.php` - Seller Orders
**Changes**:
- Only shows orders with status `'processing'` or later (paid orders)
- Excludes `'pending'` orders (unpaid)
- Returns `paymentStatus` in response

```php
->whereIn('status', ['processing', 'packing', 'shipped', 'delivered', 'cancelled'])
```

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. `Orders.jsx` - Order Grouping
**File**: `frontend/src/Components/Orders/Orders.jsx`

**Changes**:
- "To Pay" section: Only shows orders with `status === 'pending'` AND `paymentStatus !== 'paid'`
- "To Ship" section: Shows orders with `status === 'processing'`, `'packing'`, OR (`'pending'` AND `paymentStatus === 'paid'`)
- Added payment status badges:
  - âœ“ Paid (green) - for GCash/PayMaya paid orders
  - COD (yellow) - for cash on delivery orders

```javascript
'To Pay': orders.filter(order => 
  order.status === 'pending' && order.paymentStatus !== 'paid'
),
'To Ship': orders.filter(order => 
  order.status === 'processing' || 
  order.status === 'packing' ||
  (order.status === 'pending' && order.paymentStatus === 'paid')
),
```

## Status Mapping

| Order Status | Payment Status | Display Tab | Description |
|--------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| pending | pending | To Pay | COD or unpaid online order |
| pending | paid | To Ship | Paid online, ready to ship |
| processing | paid | To Ship | Being prepared for shipping |
| packing | paid | To Ship | Seller is packing |
| shipped | paid/pending | To Receive | Out for delivery |
| delivered | paid | Completed | Successfully delivered |
| cancelled | - | Return/Refund | Order cancelled |
| payment_failed | failed | Return/Refund | Payment failed |

```
