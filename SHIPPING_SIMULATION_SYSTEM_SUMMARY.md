- Database uses: `pending_payment`, `processing`, `packing`, `shipped`, `delivered`
- Shipping uses: `packing`, `to_ship`, `shipped`, `delivered`
- Different contexts use appropriate statuses

### Data Relationships:

- Order → Seller → User (for seller info)
- Order → Seller → Store (for store address)
- Order → Shipping → ShippingHistory (for tracking)
